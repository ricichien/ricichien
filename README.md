## Riciere Marcone

Hi, I’m Riciere Marcone and I currently live in Brazil. I have a Bachelor of Systems Analysis & Development from the university of technology, Fatec Ourinhos where I was taught to use not only programming languages as Java | C++ but also had basics from Python | PHP. We had access into working into projects with HTML | CSS in the academic environment as well.

### Work Experience

In one of my latest experiences as a developer, I was responsable for managing an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) project based on Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. My main task was to work at the maintenance of the project, creating pages and functionalities. This project was very important for the company and it was not only responsible to introduce me to VB.NET | TypeScript | SQL and Angular components, but also, to learn even more when dealing with Database tools along with SCRUM methodologies.

In my previous role, I was the second React Native Mobile App developer in the team. I was responsible for the transition of the main Letz's mobile apps into the new version using React Native, TypeScript and JavaScript Libraries such as Styled-Components, Jest, Amplitude, Formik, React Native, i18next and more.

The frameworks played a major role in the development and the most important ones used were the Amplitude, Jest and i18next. The Amplitude SDKs was used to send event data from the apps into Amplitude as a tool to validate user interaction. The Jest framework was used as the main testing framework for Unit Tests which was based on the Given-When-Then methodology. The i18next frameworks, was the main solution to localize the mobile apps.

The Operational System used was Linux and the development cycle consisted in reusing components for versatility or creating new ones from the beginning, code versioning for control and SCRUM methodology for productivity, conducting daily meetings (dailies), sprint planning (planning poker), retrospectives and monthly feedbacks (1on1).

### About Me

I believe that the process of learning a language helps to learn part of the region culture, moreover, I consider it is very important step that leads us to complement and improve our perspective, increase the reach for the access to new books and source materials for further gain of even more knowledge, etc.

I describe myself as someone with strong communication skills and with a great determination into creative solutions. Always open minded, dedicated at learning additional technologies and coding languages.

### Learning

Since I am already a Portuguese native speaker and fluent at English as my second language, the mainly languages I have been studying now are Italian and Japanese. Regarding technologies, I am focusing in the development of Websites using external APIs and deeping more my knowledge in Front-End stacks (React, NextJS, NodeJs, Tailwind, etc.)
