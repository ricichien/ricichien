## Riciere Marcone

Hi, I’m Riciere Marcone and I currently live in Brazil. I have a Bachelor of Systems Analysis & Development from the university of technology, Fatec Ourinhos where I was taught to use not only programming languages as Java | C++ but also had basics from Python | PHP. We had access into working into projects with HTML | CSS in the academic environment as well.

I have also developed a mobile application with React Native, including the preparation of all necessary documentation. This project was completed as part of my internship and final course project from 2020 to 2021.

### Work Experience

In my role as a Full-Stack Web Developer, I managed an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) project based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. I created and converted various screens and functionalities for data registration and management of different departments, ensuring they followed the established prototypes using technologies such as TypeScript and Angular. Additionally, I created, maintained, and tested APIs (Swagger) and their endpoints. I also developed controllers using VB.NET, managed the MySQL database, and performed messaging tests using RabbitMQ.

As a Mobile Front-End Developer, I successfully transitioned 15% of both main Letz mobile applications to their versions using the React framework (React Native), REST APIs, TypeScript, and JavaScript libraries (Styled-Components, Jest, Amplitude, Formik, i18next, and more).

I used the Linux operating system, and my development cycle consisted of reusing components for versatility or creating new ones from scratch, code versioning for control, and following the SCRUM methodology for productivity. I participated in daily meetings (dailies), sprint planning (planning poker), retrospectives, and monthly feedback sessions (1on1).

The frameworks played an important role in the development, and the most important ones used were Amplitude, Jest, and i18next. Amplitude SDKs were used to send event data from the applications to Amplitude as a tool to validate user interaction. Amplitude helps track user behavior, measure conversion rates, and analyze user engagement. The Jest framework served as the main testing framework for unit tests, following the Given-When-Then methodology. Jest provides a testing platform with a rich set of features and assertions to write reliable and efficient unit tests.

The i18next framework was the primary solution for localizing the mobile applications. It provided a comprehensive localization and internationalization solution, allowing for easy translation and adaptation of the apps' content for different languages and regions. These frameworks played vital roles in ensuring the functionality, quality, and user experience of the applications, contributing to the success of the development process.

### About Me

I possess strong interpersonal, analytical, and communication skills, with a strong focus on learning and a keen interest in new technologies and best development practices. I highly value relationships, teamwork, and have good user interface design skills. I recognize the importance of being able to contribute with a second language in the technology field, as it plays a significant role in studies, research, and career advancement.

### Learning

Since I am already a Portuguese native speaker and fluent at English as my second language, the mainly languages I have been studying now are Italian and Japanese. Regarding technologies, I am focusing in the development of Websites using external APIs and deeping more my knowledge in Front-End stacks (React, NextJS, NodeJs, Tailwind, etc.)
